  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p>The Paradyn project develops technology that aids tool and application developers in their pursuit of high-performance, 
  scalable, parallel and distributed software. The primary project, Paradyn, leverages a technique called dynamic instrumentation 
  to efficiently obtain performance profiles of unmodified executables. This dynamic binary instrumentation technology is 
  independently available to researchers via the Dyninst API.
  </p>
<p>Other research by the Paradyn project includes dynamic instrumentation of running operating system kernels, 
the Kerninst project, and the development of middleware for scalable, efficient, robust applications in the 
MRNet multicast/reduction network.</p>
